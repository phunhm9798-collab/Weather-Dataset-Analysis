A project that is based on Data Science Lover's article: [Here](https://medium.com/@datasciencelovers/python-data-analysis-project-1-50aa259b09de)

It is designed to work with the attached csv file (The name of the variables and functions presented in the base code is based on the csv file- If you wanted to make any changes to it, please consider this)

This project is created entirely on the Pandas library in Python. For more information on this library, check out the official documents : [Here]([(https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)])

columns - shows the name of each column
dtypes - It shows the data-type of each column
unique() - In a column, it shows all the unique values. It can be applied on a single column only, not on the whole dataframe.
nunique() - It shows the total no. of unique values in each column. It can be applied on a single column as well as on the whole dataframe.
count - It shows the total no. of non-null values in each column. It can be applied on a single column as well as on the whole dataframe.
